It seems like you haven't provided specific job expectations. Providing certain job expectations is crucial for updating the resume so we can fine-tune the details you need to convey to your prospective employers. 

A job expectation might detail what a particular role requires. For example, the role might require specific skills or qualifications, working experience in a certain field or industry, certain personal characteristics, etc. 

Could you tell us more about the job you're applying for? For instance, are there specific roles, qualifications, software or programming skills you want to emphasize, or any other expectations from the job description or required skills?
